Homework assignment: unit 4 game

## A Pixar Trivia

The challenge was to create a guessing game with numbers. There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page and a random number is generated at the start of the game. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
